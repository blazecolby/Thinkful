DRILL:
Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay 
their bills on time. We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out
, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects 
of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below.

ANSWER:
I would take the four categories and apply a knn to show what the default rate is for those consumers.
The main aspect that would be useful is classifying which item causes a default. 
There are probably other variations of this model.
