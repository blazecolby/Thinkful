Pacific area, or even to our\nown continental defense.\n\n,\n       He will try to\nuse the same technique of falsehood and rumor-mongering with which he\ndivided France from Britain.,\n       We can well say that our men on the fighting fronts have already proved\nthat Americans today are just as rugged and just as tough as any of the\nheroes whose exploits we celebrate on the Fourth of July.\n\n,\n       Production for war is based on metals and raw materials--steel, copper,\nrubber, aluminum, zinc, tin.,\n       We are inspired by a faith that goes back through all the years to\nthe first chapter of the Book of Genesis: \"God created man in His own\nimage.\"\n\n,\n       American armed forces must be used at any place in all the world where it\nseems advisable to engage the forces of the enemy.,\n       Our enemies are guided by brutal cynicism, by unholy contempt for the human\nrace.,\n       Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:\n\n,\n       We are\nfighting, as our fathers have fought, to uphold the doctrine that all men\nare equal in the sight of God.,\n       We are met together at a most interesting period.,\n       Their sittings have\nbeen interrupted, but are now resumed.\n\n,\n       Yes, we are fighting on the same side\nas the indomitable Dutch.,\n       The consular act relative to sea men requires revision and amendment.,\n       That is the spirit in which discussions have been conducted during the\nvisit of the British Prime Minister to Washington.,\n       But we of the United Nations are not making all this sacrifice of human\neffort and human lives to return to the kind of world we had after the last\nworld war.\n\n,\n       There were only some 400 United States Marines who in the heroic and\nhistoric defense of Wake Island inflicted such great losses on the enemy.\n,\n       They--not we--will choose the time and the place and the\nmethod of their attack.\"\n\n,\n       Various causes have hitherto\nprevented any determinations, but the business is now resumed, and\ndoubtless will be prosecuted without interruption.\n\n,\n       Their\ncities have been formed and exist upon commerce.,\n       Such circumstances call with peculiar importunity not\nless for a disposition to unite in all those measures on which the honor,\nsafety, and prosperity of our country depend than for all the exertions of\nwisdom and firmness.\n\n,\n       The\ngenius, character, and habits of the people are highly commercial.,\n       No compromise can end that conflict.,\n       Production for war is based on men and women--the human hands and brains\nwhich collectively we call Labor.,\n       St. Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace, met at Passamaquoddy Bay in\n1796 October, and viewed the mouths of the rivers in question and the\nadjacent shores and islands, and, being of opinion that actual surveys of\nboth rivers to their sources were necessary, gave to the agents of the two\nnations instructions for that purpose, and adjourned to meet at Boston in\nAugust.,\n       In\nshort, commerce has made this country what it is, and it can not be\ndestroyed or neglected without involving the people in poverty and\ndistress.,\n       We will pay this price with a will.,\n       In all such measures you may rely on my zealous and hearty concurrence.,\n       Many people ask, \"When will this war end?\",\n       The situations of the\nprincipal powers of Europe are singular and portentous.,\n       We are fighting on the same side as the brave people of China--those\nmillions who for four and a half long years have withstood bombs and\nstarvation and have whipped the invaders time and again in spite of the\nsuperior Japanese equipment and arms.,\n       Powerful and offensive actions must and will be taken in proper time.,\n       A considerable number of other claims, where costs and damages, and not\ncaptured property, were the only objects in question, have been decided by\narbitration, and the sums awarded to the citizens of the United States have\nalso been paid.\n\n,\n       It will end just as soon as we make it end, by our combined efforts,\nour combined strength, our combined determination to fight through and work\nthrough until the end--the end of militarism in Germany and Italy and\nJapan.,\n       Second, to increase our production rate of tanks so rapidly that in this\nyear, 1942, we shall produce 45,000 tanks; and to continue that increase so\nthat next year, 1943, we shall produce 75,000 tanks.\n\n,\n       They know that victory for us means victory for religion.,\n       As will\nappear in my Budget Message tomorrow, our war program for the coming fiscal\nyear will cost 56 billion dollars or, in other words, more than half of the\nestimated annual national income.,\n       In a word, it\nmeans an \"all-out\" war by individual effort and family effort in a united\ncountry.\n\n,\n       I have entertained an expectation that it would have been in my power at\nthe opening of this session to have communicated to you the agreeable\ninformation of the due execution of our treaty with His Catholic Majesty\nrespecting the withdrawing of his troops from our territory and the\ndemarcation of the line of limits, but by the latest authentic intelligence\nSpanish garrisons were still continued within our country, and the running\nof the boundary line had not been commenced.,\n       Our own objectives are clear; the objective of smashing the militarism\nimposed by war lords upon their enslaved peoples the objective of\nliberating the subjugated Nations--the objective of establishing and\nsecuring freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want, and\nfreedom from fear everywhere in the world.\n\n,\n       Although I can not yet congratulate you on the reestablishment of peace in\nEurope and the restoration of security to the persons and properties of our\ncitizens from injustice and violence at sea, we have, nevertheless,\nabundant cause of gratitude to the source of benevolence and influence for\ninterior tranquillity and personal security, for propitious seasons,\nprosperous agriculture, productive fisheries, and general improvements,\nand, above all, for a rational spirit of civil and religious liberty and a\ncalm but steady determination to support our sovereignty, as well as our\nmoral and our religious principles, against all open and secret attacks.\n\n,\n       Some foreign vessels have been discovered\nsailing under the flag of the United States and with forged papers.,\n       But this adds only to our determination to see to it that the Stars and\nStripes will fly again over Wake and Guam.,\n       \",\n       We are fighting to cleanse the world of ancient evils, ancient\nills.\n\n,\n       Another provision seems necessary\nto be added to the consular act.,\n       In proof of that, the Nazis have now announced\ntheir plan for enforcing their new German, pagan religion all over the\nworld--a plan by which the Holy Bible and the Cross of Mercy would be\ndisplaced by Mein Kampf and the swastika and the naked sword.\n\n,\n       I have just sent a letter of directive to the appropriate departments and\nagencies of our Government, ordering that immediate steps be taken:\n\nFirst, to increase our production rate of airplanes so rapidly that in this\nyear, 1942, we shall produce 60,000 planes, 10,000 more than the goal that\nwe set a year and a half ago.,\n       I submit, however, to your consideration whether a power to postpone\nthe meeting of Congress, without passing the time fixed by the Constitution\nupon such occasions, would not be a useful amendment to the law of 1794.\n\n,\n       The commissioners appointed in pursuance of the 6th article of the treaty\nmet at Philadelphia in May last to examine the claims of British subjects\nfor debts contracted before the peace and still remaining due to them from\ncitizens or inhabitants of the United States.,\n       The Fascists\nfirst revealed their imperial designs in Libya and Tripoli.,\n       They know that victory for us means victory for the institution of\ndemocracy--the ideal of the family, the simple principles of common decency\nand humanity.\n\n,\n       And finally, we\nshall continue that increase so that next year, 1943, we shall build\n10,000,000 tons of shipping.\n\n,\n       American land and air and sea forces will take stations in the British\nIsles--which constitute an essential fortress in this great world\nstruggle.\n\n,\n       We do not\nshrink from such decisions.,\n       We now know their choice of the time: a peaceful Sunday morning--December\n7, 1941.\n\n,\n       They would wreck the power of the British Commonwealth and Russia\nand China and the Netherlands--and then combine all their forces to achieve\ntheir ultimate goal, the conquest of the United States.\n\n,\n       We must guard against complacency.,\n       It was not merely a\npolicy of seeking living room: it was a plan which included the subjugation\nof all the peoples in the Far East and in the islands of the Pacific, and\nthe domination of that ocean by Japanese military and naval control of the\nwestern coasts of North, Central, and South America.\n\n,\n       We must\nconvert every available plant and tool to war production.,\n       Greater and greater quantities of them will\nhave to be diverted to war purposes.,\n       We must not underrate the enemy.,\n       Nothing, in the mean\ntime, will contribute so much to the preservation of peace and the\nattainment of justice as manifestation of that energy and unanimity of\nwhich on many former occasions the people of the United States have given\nsuch memorable proofs, and the exertion of those resources for national\ndefense which a beneficent Providence has kindly placed within their\npower.\n\n,\n       For the first time since the Japanese and the Fascists and the Nazis\nstarted along their blood-stained course of conquest they now face the fact\nthat superior forces are assembling against them.,\n       Those on the other side are striving to\ndestroy this deep belief and to create a world in their own image--a world\nof tyranny and cruelty and serfdom.\n\n,\n       The development of this ambitious conspiracy was marked by the war against\nChina in 1894; the subsequent occupation of Korea; the war against Russia\nin 1904; the illegal fortification of the mandated Pacific islands\nfollowing 1920; the seizure of Manchuria in 1931; and the invasion of China\nin 1937.\n\n,\n       Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:\n\n,\n       When our enemies challenged our country to stand up and fight, they\nchallenged each and every one of us.,\n       There will\nbe a continuation of conferences and consultations among military staffs,\nso that the plans and operations of each will fit into the general strategy\ndesigned to crush the enemy.,\n       Only this all-out scale of production will hasten the ultimate all-out\nvictory.,\n       Lost ground can always be regained--lost time\nnever.,\n       Great activity has been exerted by\nthose persons who have insinuated themselves among the Indian tribes\nresiding within the territory of the United States to influence them to\ntransfer their affections and force to a foreign nation, to form them into\na confederacy, and prepare them for war against the United States.,\n       The superiority of the United Nations in munitions and ships must be\noverwhelming--so overwhelming that the Axis Nations can never hope to catch\nup with it.,\n       In other\ncases, these operations will be offensive, in order to strike at the common\nenemy, with a view to his complete encirclement and eventual total defeat.\n\n,\n       Those plans provided for ultimate domination, not of any one section\nof the world, but of the whole earth and all the oceans on it.\n\n,\n       The national defense\nmust be provided for as well as the support of Government; but both should\nbe accomplished as much as possible by immediate taxes, and as little as\npossible by loans.\n\n,\n       Connected with some\nby treaties and with all by commerce, no important event there can be\nindifferent to us.,\n       Already we have established, as you know, unified command of land,\nsea, and air forces in the southwestern Pacific theater of war.,\n       This measure it was\ndesirable to avoid, because it would occasion much public inconvenience and\na considerable public expense and add to the calamities of the inhabitants\nof this city, whose sufferings must have excited the sympathy of all their\nfellow citizens.,\n       So far, we have hardly even begun to pay for it.,\n       I know that I speak for the\nAmerican people--and I have good reason to believe that I speak also for\nall the other peoples who fight with us--when I say that this time we are\ndetermined not only to win the war, but also to maintain the security of\nthe peace that will follow.\n\n,\n       Our agriculture,\nfisheries, arts, and manufactures are connected with and depend upon it.,\n       It will not be sufficient for us and the other United Nations to produce a\nslightly superior supply of munitions to that of Germany, Japan, Italy, and\nthe stolen industries in the countries which they have overrun.\n\n,\n       We have not been stunned.,\n       It was bitter for us not to be able to land a million men in a\nthousand ships in the Philippine Islands.\n\n,\n       We know their choice of the place: an American outpost in the Pacific.\n\n,\n       Destruction of the material and spiritual centers of civilization--this has\nbeen and still is the purpose of Hitler and his Italian and Japanese\nchessmen.,\n       He has trained his people to\nbelieve that their highest perfection is achieved by waging war.,\n       American armed forces will be on all the oceans--helping to guard the\nessential communications which are vital to the United Nations.\n\n,\n       And I\nthink that it is a fair prophecy to say that, as we get guns to the\npatriots in those lands, they too will fire shots heard 'round the world.\n\n,\n       And fourth, to increase our production rate of merchant ships so rapidly\nthat in this year, 1942, we shall build 6,000,000 deadweight tons as\ncompared with a 1941 completed production of 1,100,000.,\n       It may be confidently asserted that nothing has occurred since the\nadjournment of Congress which renders inexpedient those precautionary\nmeasures recommended by me to the consideration of the two Houses at the\nopening of your late extraordinary session.,\n       It\nseldom happens that the consuls can detect this deception, because they\nhave no authority to demand an inspection of the registers and sea\nletters.\n\n,\n       War costs money.,\n       When the survivors of that great fight are liberated and restored to\ntheir homes, they will learn that a hundred and thirty million of their\nfellow citizens have been inspired to render their own full share of\nservice and sacrifice.\n\n,\n       We must face the fact of a hard war, a long war, a\nbloody war, a costly war.\n\n,\n       We cannot wage this war in a defensive spirit.,\n       Plans have been laid here and in the other capitals for coordinated and\ncooperative action by all the United Nations--military action and economic\naction.,\n       He will stop at nothing that\ngives him a chance to kill and to destroy.,\n       Together, during the\npast two weeks, we have faced squarely the major military and economic\nproblems of this greatest world war.\n\n,\n       Our envoys extraordinary to the French Republic embarked--one in July, the\nother in August--to join their colleague in Holland.,\n       Whatever the price, it is a thousand\ntimes worth it.,\n       That mood is stronger than any mere desire for revenge.,\n       We on our side are striving to be true to that divine heritage.,\n       The plan has failed in its purpose.,\n       These figures and similar figures for a multitude of other implements of\nwar will give the Japanese and the Nazis a little idea of just what they\naccomplished in the attack at Pearl Harbor.\n\n,\n       We must raise our sights all\nalong the production line.,\n       The faith of society is pledged for the preservation of the rights of\ncommercial and sea faring no less than of the other citizens.,\n       Although\nmeasures have been taken to counteract these infractions of our rights, to\nprevent Indian hostilities, and to preserve entire their attachment to the\nUnited States, it is my duty to observe that to give a better effect to\nthese measures and to obviate the consequences of a repetition of such\npractices a law providing adequate punishment for such offenses may be\nnecessary.\n\n,\n       This production of ours in the United States must be raised far above\npresent levels, even though it will mean the dislocation of the lives and\noccupations of millions of our own people.,\n       He is welcome in our midst, and\nwe unite in wishing him a safe return to his home.\n\n,\n       It will not be used successfully on the American people.\n\n,\n       I was for some time apprehensive that it would be necessary, on account of\nthe contagious sickness which afflicted the city of Philadelphia, to\nconvene the National Legislature at some other place.,\n       Speed will save lives; speed will save this Nation which is in\nperil; speed will save our freedom and our civilization--and slowness has\nnever been an American characteristic.\n\n,\n       Only total victory can\nreward the champions of tolerance, and decency, and freedom, and faith.,\n       I have received\nintelligence of the arrival of both of them in Holland, from whence they\nall proceeded on their journeys to Paris within a few days of the 19th of\nSeptember.,\n       Even\nbefore they came to power in 1933, their plans for that conquest had been\ndrawn.,\n       Difficult choices may have to be made in the months to come.,\n       The\nconsolidation of the United Nations' total war effort against our common\nenemies is being achieved.\n\n,\n       The rate of increase will be maintained and\ncontinued so that next year, 1943, we shall produce 125,000 airplanes,\nincluding 100,000 combat planes.\n\n,\n       We may\nsuffer further setbacks.,\n       We and those united with us will make those\ndecisions with courage and determination.\n\n,\n       We must\nstrain every existing armament-producing facility to the utmost.,\n       We have\ndevoted only 15 percent of our national income to national defense.,\n       In 1935 they\nseized Abyssinia., \",\n       When Hitler organized his Berlin-Rome-Tokyo alliance, all these plans of\nconquest became a single plan.,\n       That goes all the\nway from the greatest plants to the smallest--from the huge automobile\nindustry to the village machine shop.\n\n,\n       It expresses the\nwill of the American people to make very certain that the world will never\nso suffer again.\n\n,\n       American armed forces will help to protect this hemisphere--and also help to\nprotect bases outside this hemisphere, which could be used for an attack on\nthe Americas.\n\n,\n       For we are fighting on the same side with the British people, who fought\nalone for long, terrible months, and withstood the enemy with fortitude and\ntenacity and skill.\n\n,\n       We shall not stop short of these objectives--nor shall we be satisfied\nmerely to gain them and then call it a day.,\n       The consuls have in\nthese cases also advanced moneys for their relief.,\n       Let no man say it cannot be done.,\n       This very reassembling of the Seventy-seventh\nCongress today is proof of that; for the mood of quiet, grim resolution\nwhich here prevails bodes ill for those who conspired and collaborated to\nmurder world peace.\n\n,\n       Most certainly we shall not settle for less.\n\n,\n       It must be\ndone--and we have undertaken to do it.\n\n,\n       The commissioners appointed agreeably to the 21st article of our treaty\nwith Spain met at Philadelphia in the summer past to examine and decide on\nthe claims of our citizens for losses they have sustained in consequence of\ntheir vessels and cargoes having been taken by the subjects of His Catholic\nMajesty during the late war between Spain and France.,\n       We of the United Nations will so dispose our\nforces that we can strike at the common enemy wherever the greatest damage\ncan be done him.\n\n,\n       They realize\nwell that on the speed and efficiency of their work depend the lives of\ntheir sons and their brothers on the fighting fronts.\n\n,\n       That is the conflict that day and night now pervades our lives.\n\n,\n       If any of our enemies, from Europe or from Asia, attempt long-range raids\nby \"suicide\" squadrons of bombing planes, they will do so only in the hope\nof terrorizing our people and disrupting our morale.,\n       The numerous captures of American vessels by the cruisers of the French\nRepublic and of some by those of Spain have occasioned considerable\nexpenses in making and supporting the claims of our citizens before their\ntribunals.,\n       These 26 Nations are united--not in spirit and\ndetermination alone, but in the broad conduct of the war in all its\nphases.\n\n,\n       Exactly one year ago today I said to this Congress:,\n       The sums required for this purpose have in divers instances been\ndisbursed by the consuls of the United States.,\n       We must be particularly vigilant against racial\ndiscrimination in any of its ugly forms.,\n       There is only one answer to\nthat.,\n       For these advances they\nreasonably expect reimbursements from the United States.\n\n,\n       It is my duty to recommend to your serious consideration those objects\nwhich by the Constitution are placed particularly within your sphere--the\nnational debts and taxes.\n\n,\n       Hitler will try again to breed\nmistrust and suspicion between one individual and another, one group and\nanother, one race and another, one Government and another.,\n       Mr. Churchill and I\nunderstand each other, our motives and our purposes.,\n       Therefore, after taking measures to ascertain the state\nand decline of the sickness, I postponed my determination, having hopes,\nnow happily realized, that, without hazard to the lives or health of the\nmembers, Congress might assemble at this place, where it was next by law to\nmeet.,\n       The\nprovisions for their support in foreign countries and for their return are\nfound to be inadequate and ineffectual.,\n       The response of the American people has been instantaneous, and it will be\nsustained until our security is assured.\n\n,\n       The commissioners appointed under the 5th article of the treaty of amity,\ncommerce, and navigation between the United States and Great Britain to\nascertain the river which was truly intended under the name of the river\n,\n       We are fighting on the same side as all the other\nGovernments in exile, whom Hitler and all his armies and all his Gestapo\nhave not been able to conquer.\n\n,\n       The militarists of Berlin and Tokyo started this war.,\n       If that system was then\nprudent, it is more so now, as increasing depredations strengthen the\nreasons for its adoption.\n\n,\n       They met, but the surveys requiring more time than had been\nsupposed, and not being then completed, the commissioners again adjourned,\nto meet at Providence, in the State of Rhode Island, in June next, when we\nmay expect a final examination and decision.\n\n,\n       Indeed, whatever may be the issue of the negotiation with France, and\nwhether the war in Europe is or is not to continue, I hold it most certain\nthat permanent tranquillity and order will not soon be obtained.,\n       Admittedly, we have been faced with hard choices.,\n       And our overwhelming superiority of armament must be adequate to put\nweapons of war at the proper time into the hands of those men in the\nconquered Nations who stand ready to seize the first opportunity to revolt\nagainst their German and Japanese oppressors, and against the traitors in\ntheir own ranks, known by the already infamous name of \"Quislings.,\n       Their goal was the domination of all North Africa, Egypt,\nparts of France, and the entire Mediterranean world.\n\n,\n       This includes 45,000 combat planes--bombers,\ndive bombers, pursuit planes.,\n       The\nsums awarded by the commissioners have been paid by the British Government.\n,\n       We have been\ndeeply stirred by his great message to us.,\n       That was and is the purpose of conferences which have been held during the\npast two weeks in Washington, and Moscow and Chungking.,\n       We have already tasted defeat.,\n       That is the primary\nobjective of the declaration of solidarity signed in Washington on January\n1, 1942, by 26 Nations united against the Axis powers.\n\n,\n       By means of the same\ncaptures great numbers of our sea men have been thrown ashore in foreign\ncountries, destitute of all means of subsistence, and the sick in\nparticular have been exposed to grievous sufferings.,\n       The consequences arising from the\ncontinual accumulation of public debts in other countries ought to admonish\nus to be careful to prevent their growth in our own.,\n       In connection with this unpleasant state of things on our western frontier\nit is proper for me to mention the attempts of foreign agents to alienate\nthe affections of the Indian nations and to excite them to actual\nhostilities against the United States.,\n       Great numbers are directly and solely supported by navigation.\n,\n       In fulfilling my duty to report upon the State of the Union, I am proud to\nsay to you that the spirit of the American people was never higher than it\nis today--the Union was never more closely knit together--this country was\nnever more deeply determined to face the solemn tasks before it.\n\n,\n       Several decisions on the claims of citizens of the United States for losses\nand damages sustained by reason of irregular and illegal captures or\ncondemnations of their vessels or other property have been made by the\ncommissioners in London conformably to the 7th article of the treaty.,\n       For many\nyears he has prepared for this very conflict--planning, and plotting, and\ntraining, arming, and fighting.], dtype=object),)",

Britain.,\n       We can well say that our men on the fighting fronts have already proved\nthat Americans today are just as rugged and just as tough as any of the\nheroes whose exploits we celebrate on the Fourth of July.\n\n,\n       Production for war is based on metals and raw materials--steel, copper,\nrubber, aluminum, zinc, tin.,\n       We are inspired by a faith that goes back through all the years to\nthe first chapter of the Book of Genesis: \"God created man in His own\nimage.\"\n\n,\n       American armed forces must be used at any place in all the world where it\nseems advisable to engage the forces of the enemy.,\n       Our enemies are guided by brutal cynicism, by unholy contempt for the human\nrace.,\n       Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:\n\n,\n       We are\nfighting, as our fathers have fought, to uphold the doctrine that all men\nare equal in the sight of God.,\n       We are met together at a most interesting period.,\n       Their sittings have\nbeen interrupted, but are now resumed.\n\n,\n       Yes, we are fighting on the same side\nas the indomitable Dutch.,\n       The consular act relative to sea men requires revision and amendment.,\n       That is the spirit in which discussions have been conducted during the\nvisit of the British Prime Minister to Washington.,\n       But we of the United Nations are not making all this sacrifice of human\neffort and human lives to return to the kind of world we had after the last\nworld war.\n\n,\n       There were only some 400 United States Marines who in the heroic and\nhistoric defense of Wake Island inflicted such great losses on the enemy.\n,\n       They--not we--will choose the time and the place and the\nmethod of their attack.\"\n\n,\n       Various causes have hitherto\nprevented any determinations, but the business is now resumed, and\ndoubtless will be prosecuted without interruption.\n\n,\n       Their\ncities have been formed and exist upon commerce.,\n       Such circumstances call with peculiar importunity not\nless for a disposition to unite in all those measures on which the honor,\nsafety, and prosperity of our country depend than for all the exertions of\nwisdom and firmness.\n\n,\n       The\ngenius, character, and habits of the people are highly commercial.,\n       No compromise can end that conflict.,\n       Production for war is based on men and women--the human hands and brains\nwhich collectively we call Labor.,\n       St. Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace, met at Passamaquoddy Bay in\n1796 October, and viewed the mouths of the rivers in question and the\nadjacent shores and islands, and, being of opinion that actual surveys of\nboth rivers to their sources were necessary, gave to the agents of the two\nnations instructions for that purpose, and adjourned to meet at Boston in\nAugust.,\n       In\nshort, commerce has made this country what it is, and it can not be\ndestroyed or neglected without involving the people in poverty and\ndistress.,\n       We will pay this price with a will.,\n       In all such measures you may rely on my zealous and hearty concurrence.,\n       Many people ask, \"When will this war end?\",\n       The situations of the\nprincipal powers of Europe are singular and portentous.,\n       We are fighting on the same side as the brave people of China--those\nmillions who for four and a half long years have withstood bombs and\nstarvation and have whipped the invaders time and again in spite of the\nsuperior Japanese equipment and arms.,\n       Powerful and offensive actions must and will be taken in proper time.,\n       A considerable number of other claims, where costs and damages, and not\ncaptured property, were the only objects in question, have been decided by\narbitration, and the sums awarded to the citizens of the United States have\nalso been paid.\n\n,\n       It will end just as soon as we make it end, by our combined efforts,\nour combined strength, our combined determination to fight through and work\nthrough until the end--the end of militarism in Germany and Italy and\nJapan.,\n       Second, to increase our production rate of tanks so rapidly that in this\nyear, 1942, we shall produce 45,000 tanks; and to continue that increase so\nthat next year, 1943, we shall produce 75,000 tanks.\n\n,\n       They know that victory for us means victory for religion.,\n       As will\nappear in my Budget Message tomorrow, our war program for the coming fiscal\nyear will cost 56 billion dollars or, in other words, more than half of the\nestimated annual national income.,\n       In a word, it\nmeans an \"all-out\" war by individual effort and family effort in a united\ncountry.\n\n,\n       I have entertained an expectation that it would have been in my power at\nthe opening of this session to have communicated to you the agreeable\ninformation of the due execution of our treaty with His Catholic Majesty\nrespecting the withdrawing of his troops from our territory and the\ndemarcation of the line of limits, but by the latest authentic intelligence\nSpanish garrisons were still continued within our country, and the running\nof the boundary line had not been commenced.,\n       Our own objectives are clear; the objective of smashing the militarism\nimposed by war lords upon their enslaved peoples the objective of\nliberating the subjugated Nations--the objective of establishing and\nsecuring freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want, and\nfreedom from fear everywhere in the world.\n\n,\n       Although I can not yet congratulate you on the reestablishment of peace in\nEurope and the restoration of security to the persons and properties of our\ncitizens from injustice and violence at sea, we have, nevertheless,\nabundant cause of gratitude to the source of benevolence and influence for\ninterior tranquillity and personal security, for propitious seasons,\nprosperous agriculture, productive fisheries, and general improvements,\nand, above all, for a rational spirit of civil and religious liberty and a\ncalm but steady determination to support our sovereignty, as well as our\nmoral and our religious principles, against all open and secret attacks.\n\n,\n       Some foreign vessels have been discovered\nsailing under the flag of the United States and with forged papers.,\n       But this adds only to our determination to see to it that the Stars and\nStripes will fly again over Wake and Guam.,\n       \",\n       We are fighting to cleanse the world of ancient evils, ancient\nills.\n\n,\n       Another provision seems necessary\nto be added to the consular act.,\n       In proof of that, the Nazis have now announced\ntheir plan for enforcing their new German, pagan religion all over the\nworld--a plan by which the Holy Bible and the Cross of Mercy would be\ndisplaced by Mein Kampf and the swastika and the naked sword.\n\n,\n       I have just sent a letter of directive to the appropriate departments and\nagencies of our Government, ordering that immediate steps be taken:\n\nFirst, to increase our production rate of airplanes so rapidly that in this\nyear, 1942, we shall produce 60,000 planes, 10,000 more than the goal that\nwe set a year and a half ago.,\n       I submit, however, to your consideration whether a power to postpone\nthe meeting of Congress, without passing the time fixed by the Constitution\nupon such occasions, would not be a useful amendment to the law of 1794.\n\n,\n       The commissioners appointed in pursuance of the 6th article of the treaty\nmet at Philadelphia in May last to examine the claims of British subjects\nfor debts contracted before the peace and still remaining due to them from\ncitizens or inhabitants of the United States.,\n       The Fascists\nfirst revealed their imperial designs in Libya and Tripoli.,\n       They know that victory for us means victory for the institution of\ndemocracy--the ideal of the family, the simple principles of common decency\nand humanity.\n\n,\n       And finally, we\nshall continue that increase so that next year, 1943, we shall build\n10,000,000 tons of shipping.\n\n,\n       American land and air and sea forces will take stations in the British\nIsles--which constitute an essential fortress in this great world\nstruggle.\n\n,\n       We do not\nshrink from such decisions.,\n       We now know their choice of the time: a peaceful Sunday morning--December\n7, 1941.\n\n,\n       They would wreck the power of the British Commonwealth and Russia\nand China and the Netherlands--and then combine all their forces to achieve\ntheir ultimate goal, the conquest of the United States.\n\n,\n       We must guard against complacency.,\n       It was not merely a\npolicy of seeking living room: it was a plan which included the subjugation\nof all the peoples in the Far East and in the islands of the Pacific, and\nthe domination of that ocean by Japanese military and naval control of the\nwestern coasts of North, Central, and South America.\n\n,\n       We must\nconvert every available plant and tool to war production.,\n       Greater and greater quantities of them will\nhave to be diverted to war purposes.,\n       We must not underrate the enemy.,\n       Nothing, in the mean\ntime, will contribute so much to the preservation of peace and the\nattainment of justice as manifestation of that energy and unanimity of\nwhich on many former occasions the people of the United States have given\nsuch memorable proofs, and the exertion of those resources for national\ndefense which a beneficent Providence has kindly placed within their\npower.\n\n,\n       For the first time since the Japanese and the Fascists and the Nazis\nstarted along their blood-stained course of conquest they now face the fact\nthat superior forces are assembling against them.,\n       Those on the other side are striving to\ndestroy this deep belief and to create a world in their own image--a world\nof tyranny and cruelty and serfdom.\n\n,\n       The development of this ambitious conspiracy was marked by the war against\nChina in 1894; the subsequent occupation of Korea; the war against Russia\nin 1904; the illegal fortification of the mandated Pacific islands\nfollowing 1920; the seizure of Manchuria in 1931; and the invasion of China\nin 1937.\n\n,\n       Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:\n\n,\n       When our enemies challenged our country to stand up and fight, they\nchallenged each and every one of us.,\n       There will\nbe a continuation of conferences and consultations among military staffs,\nso that the plans and operations of each will fit into the general strategy\ndesigned to crush the enemy.,\n       Only this all-out scale of production will hasten the ultimate all-out\nvictory.,\n       Lost ground can always be regained--lost time\nnever.,\n       Great activity has been exerted by\nthose persons who have insinuated themselves among the Indian tribes\nresiding within the territory of the United States to influence them to\ntransfer their affections and force to a foreign nation, to form them into\na confederacy, and prepare them for war against the United States.,\n       The superiority of the United Nations in munitions and ships must be\noverwhelming--so overwhelming that the Axis Nations can never hope to catch\nup with it.,\n       In other\ncases, these operations will be offensive, in order to strike at the common\nenemy, with a view to his complete encirclement and eventual total defeat.\n\n,\n       Those plans provided for ultimate domination, not of any one section\nof the world, but of the whole earth and all the oceans on it.\n\n,\n       The national defense\nmust be provided for as well as the support of Government; but both should\nbe accomplished as much as possible by immediate taxes, and as little as\npossible by loans.\n\n,\n       Connected with some\nby treaties and with all by commerce, no important event there can be\nindifferent to us.,\n       Already we have established, as you know, unified command of land,\nsea, and air forces in the southwestern Pacific theater of war.,\n       This measure it was\ndesirable to avoid, because it would occasion much public inconvenience and\na considerable public expense and add to the calamities of the inhabitants\nof this city, whose sufferings must have excited the sympathy of all their\nfellow citizens.,\n       So far, we have hardly even begun to pay for it.,\n       I know that I speak for the\nAmerican people--and I have good reason to believe that I speak also for\nall the other peoples who fight with us--when I say that this time we are\ndetermined not only to win the war, but also to maintain the security of\nthe peace that will follow.\n\n,\n       Our agriculture,\nfisheries, arts, and manufactures are connected with and depend upon it.,\n       It will not be sufficient for us and the other United Nations to produce a\nslightly superior supply of munitions to that of Germany, Japan, Italy, and\nthe stolen industries in the countries which they have overrun.\n\n,\n       We have not been stunned.,\n       It was bitter for us not to be able to land a million men in a\nthousand ships in the Philippine Islands.\n\n,\n       We know their choice of the place: an American outpost in the Pacific.\n\n,\n       Destruction of the material and spiritual centers of civilization--this has\nbeen and still is the purpose of Hitler and his Italian and Japanese\nchessmen.,\n       He has trained his people to\nbelieve that their highest perfection is achieved by waging war.,\n       American armed forces will be on all the oceans--helping to guard the\nessential communications which are vital to the United Nations.\n\n,\n       And I\nthink that it is a fair prophecy to say that, as we get guns to the\npatriots in those lands, they too will fire shots heard 'round the world.\n\n,\n       And fourth, to increase our production rate of merchant ships so rapidly\nthat in this year, 1942, we shall build 6,000,000 deadweight tons as\ncompared with a 1941 completed production of 1,100,000.,\n       It may be confidently asserted that nothing has occurred since the\nadjournment of Congress which renders inexpedient those precautionary\nmeasures recommended by me to the consideration of the two Houses at the\nopening of your late extraordinary session.,\n       It\nseldom happens that the consuls can detect this deception, because they\nhave no authority to demand an inspection of the registers and sea\nletters.\n\n,\n       War costs money.,\n       When the survivors of that great fight are liberated and restored to\ntheir homes, they will learn that a hundred and thirty million of their\nfellow citizens have been inspired to render their own full share of\nservice and sacrifice.\n\n,\n       We must face the fact of a hard war, a long war, a\nbloody war, a costly war.\n\n,\n       We cannot wage this war in a defensive spirit.,\n       Plans have been laid here and in the other capitals for coordinated and\ncooperative action by all the United Nations--military action and economic\naction.,\n       He will stop at nothing that\ngives him a chance to kill and to destroy.,\n       Together, during the\npast two weeks, we have faced squarely the major military and economic\nproblems of this greatest world war.\n\n,\n       Our envoys extraordinary to the French Republic embarked--one in July, the\nother in August--to join their colleague in Holland.,\n       Whatever the price, it is a thousand\ntimes worth it.,\n       That mood is stronger than any mere desire for revenge.,\n       We on our side are striving to be true to that divine heritage.,\n       The plan has failed in its purpose.,\n       These figures and similar figures for a multitude of other implements of\nwar will give the Japanese and the Nazis a little idea of just what they\naccomplished in the attack at Pearl Harbor.\n\n,\n       We must raise our sights all\nalong the production line.,\n       The faith of society is pledged for the preservation of the rights of\ncommercial and sea faring no less than of the other citizens.,\n       Although\nmeasures have been taken to counteract these infractions of our rights, to\nprevent Indian hostilities, and to preserve entire their attachment to the\nUnited States, it is my duty to observe that to give a better effect to\nthese measures and to obviate the consequences of a repetition of such\npractices a law providing adequate punishment for such offenses may be\nnecessary.\n\n,\n       This production of ours in the United States must be raised far above\npresent levels, even though it will mean the dislocation of the lives and\noccupations of millions of our own people.,\n       He is welcome in our midst, and\nwe unite in wishing him a safe return to his home.\n\n,\n       It will not be used successfully on the American people.\n\n,\n       I was for some time apprehensive that it would be necessary, on account of\nthe contagious sickness which afflicted the city of Philadelphia, to\nconvene the National Legislature at some other place.,\n       Speed will save lives; speed will save this Nation which is in\nperil; speed will save our freedom and our civilization--and slowness has\nnever been an American characteristic.\n\n,\n       Only total victory can\nreward the champions of tolerance, and decency, and freedom, and faith.,\n       I have received\nintelligence of the arrival of both of them in Holland, from whence they\nall proceeded on their journeys to Paris within a few days of the 19th of\nSeptember.,\n       Even\nbefore they came to power in 1933, their plans for that conquest had been\ndrawn.,\n       Difficult choices may have to be made in the months to come.,\n       The\nconsolidation of the United Nations' total war effort against our common\nenemies is being achieved.\n\n,\n       The rate of increase will be maintained and\ncontinued so that next year, 1943, we shall produce 125,000 airplanes,\nincluding 100,000 combat planes.\n\n,\n       We may\nsuffer further setbacks.,\n       We and those united with us will make those\ndecisions with courage and determination.\n\n,\n       We must\nstrain every existing armament-producing facility to the utmost.,\n       We have\ndevoted only 15 percent of our national income to national defense.,\n       In 1935 they\nseized Abyssinia., \",\n       When Hitler organized his Berlin-Rome-Tokyo alliance, all these plans of\nconquest became a single plan.,\n       That goes all the\nway from the greatest plants to the smallest--from the huge automobile\nindustry to the village machine shop.\n\n,\n       It expresses the\nwill of the American people to make very certain that the world will never\nso suffer again.\n\n,\n       American armed forces will help to protect this hemisphere--and also help to\nprotect bases outside this hemisphere, which could be used for an attack on\nthe Americas.\n\n,\n       For we are fighting on the same side with the British people, who fought\nalone for long, terrible months, and withstood the enemy with fortitude and\ntenacity and skill.\n\n,\n       We shall not stop short of these objectives--nor shall we be satisfied\nmerely to gain them and then call it a day.,\n       The consuls have in\nthese cases also advanced moneys for their relief.,\n       Let no man say it cannot be done.,\n       This very reassembling of the Seventy-seventh\nCongress today is proof of that; for the mood of quiet, grim resolution\nwhich here prevails bodes ill for those who conspired and collaborated to\nmurder world peace.\n\n,\n       Most certainly we shall not settle for less.\n\n,\n       It must be\ndone--and we have undertaken to do it.\n\n,\n       The commissioners appointed agreeably to the 21st article of our treaty\nwith Spain met at Philadelphia in the summer past to examine and decide on\nthe claims of our citizens for losses they have sustained in consequence of\ntheir vessels and cargoes having been taken by the subjects of His Catholic\nMajesty during the late war between Spain and France.,\n       We of the United Nations will so dispose our\nforces that we can strike at the common enemy wherever the greatest damage\ncan be done him.\n\n,\n       They realize\nwell that on the speed and efficiency of their work depend the lives of\ntheir sons and their brothers on the fighting fronts.\n\n,\n       That is the conflict that day and night now pervades our lives.\n\n,\n       If any of our enemies, from Europe or from Asia, attempt long-range raids\nby \"suicide\" squadrons of bombing planes, they will do so only in the hope\nof terrorizing our people and disrupting our morale.,\n       The numerous captures of American vessels by the cruisers of the French\nRepublic and of some by those of Spain have occasioned considerable\nexpenses in making and supporting the claims of our citizens before their\ntribunals.,\n       These 26 Nations are united--not in spirit and\ndetermination alone, but in the broad conduct of the war in all its\nphases.\n\n,\n       Exactly one year ago today I said to this Congress:,\n       The sums required for this purpose have in divers instances been\ndisbursed by the consuls of the United States.,\n       We must be particularly vigilant against racial\ndiscrimination in any of its ugly forms.,\n       There is only one answer to\nthat.,\n       For these advances they\nreasonably expect reimbursements from the United States.\n\n,\n       It is my duty to recommend to your serious consideration those objects\nwhich by the Constitution are placed particularly within your sphere--the\nnational debts and taxes.\n\n,\n       Hitler will try again to breed\nmistrust and suspicion between one individual and another, one group and\nanother, one race and another, one Government and another.,\n       Mr. Churchill and I\nunderstand each other, our motives and our purposes.,\n       Therefore, after taking measures to ascertain the state\nand decline of the sickness, I postponed my determination, having hopes,\nnow happily realized, that, without hazard to the lives or health of the\nmembers, Congress might assemble at this place, where it was next by law to\nmeet.,\n       The\nprovisions for their support in foreign countries and for their return are\nfound to be inadequate and ineffectual.,\n       The response of the American people has been instantaneous, and it will be\nsustained until our security is assured.\n\n,\n       The commissioners appointed under the 5th article of the treaty of amity,\ncommerce, and navigation between the United States and Great Britain to\nascertain the river which was truly intended under the name of the river\n,\n       We are fighting on the same side as all the other\nGovernments in exile, whom Hitler and all his armies and all his Gestapo\nhave not been able to conquer.\n\n,\n       The militarists of Berlin and Tokyo started this war.,\n       If that system was then\nprudent, it is more so now, as increasing depredations strengthen the\nreasons for its adoption.\n\n,\n       They met, but the surveys requiring more time than had been\nsupposed, and not being then completed, the commissioners again adjourned,\nto meet at Providence, in the State of Rhode Island, in June next, when we\nmay expect a final examination and decision.\n\n,\n       Indeed, whatever may be the issue of the negotiation with France, and\nwhether the war in Europe is or is not to continue, I hold it most certain\nthat permanent tranquillity and order will not soon be obtained.,\n       Admittedly, we have been faced with hard choices.,\n       And our overwhelming superiority of armament must be adequate to put\nweapons of war at the proper time into the hands of those men in the\nconquered Nations who stand ready to seize the first opportunity to revolt\nagainst their German and Japanese oppressors, and against the traitors in\ntheir own ranks, known by the already infamous name of \"Quislings.,\n       Their goal was the domination of all North Africa, Egypt,\nparts of France, and the entire Mediterranean world.\n\n,\n       This includes 45,000 combat planes--bombers,\ndive bombers, pursuit planes.,\n       The\nsums awarded by the commissioners have been paid by the British Government.\n,\n       We have been\ndeeply stirred by his great message to us.,\n       That was and is the purpose of conferences which have been held during the\npast two weeks in Washington, and Moscow and Chungking.,\n       We have already tasted defeat.,\n       That is the primary\nobjective of the declaration of solidarity signed in Washington on January\n1, 1942, by 26 Nations united against the Axis powers.\n\n,\n       By means of the same\ncaptures great numbers of our sea men have been thrown ashore in foreign\ncountries, destitute of all means of subsistence, and the sick in\nparticular have been exposed to grievous sufferings.,\n       The consequences arising from the\ncontinual accumulation of public debts in other countries ought to admonish\nus to be careful to prevent their growth in our own.,\n       In connection with this unpleasant state of things on our western frontier\nit is proper for me to mention the attempts of foreign agents to alienate\nthe affections of the Indian nations and to excite them to actual\nhostilities against the United States.,\n       Great numbers are directly and solely supported by navigation.\n,\n       In fulfilling my duty to report upon the State of the Union, I am proud to\nsay to you that the spirit of the American people was never higher than it\nis today--the Union was never more closely knit together--this country was\nnever more deeply determined to face the solemn tasks before it.\n\n,\n       Several decisions on the claims of citizens of the United States for losses\nand damages sustained by reason of irregular and illegal captures or\ncondemnations of their vessels or other property have been made by the\ncommissioners in London conformably to the 7th article of the treaty.,\n       For many\nyears he has prepared for this very conflict--planning, and plotting, and\ntraining, arming, and fighting.], dtype=object),)"
