1) 
Compare the product sales numbers for each product. Look at the highest converting ads, which product specific ad is performing the best? Assuming that I know what the product margins are; I would select the product that is bringing in the most gross profit. Don't just look at what product has the highest units sold. One could also compare session metrics for each product to see if there are any places that could be improved. i.e. a lot of people exit after a certain popup appears.  

2) 
First find low numbers for conversions. Look for low conversions on any buttons, forms, or pages. If there are any low conversions I would take all of the data for that specific feature/page and compare it along different time lines. I would compare the 3 years with one another; I would look seasonal commonalities/anomolies. I could also look to see if there were any changes to the site around the past 3 years. Maybe the company changed a landing page and forgot to update a link so they have one less button that people were clicking on before hand. I would also look at the marketing spend, compare each years spend and look for similarities/differences. The company could have made changes to where the money is going. Most advertising campaigns don't last for 3 years. That would one place to look for things that stand out. They could have started a new campaign and customers aren't reacting to at all. Basically just follow the breadcrumbs; if there is a drop look for the things that stand out. This might be within the company or outside. 

3) I would allow the hotels to be sorted by multiple criteria: location, price, availability, and popularity of the hotel. 

4) 
I would look at the full 3 years of data and try to find noticeable changes in the data. I would be looking at login data and trying to find drops in the number of logins, and do the same with the amount of time each user spends on each session. If there are any drops I would compare each years' data to see if there are repeating seasonal drops among the number of users or session time spent. I could also look at the time stamp in terms of the time of day that users are logging in. I could compare the average daily time for a year, then compare each year. This might show outliers, sudden and constitent changes, as well as gradual changes. Gradual changes could be from an internal change; maybe the company changed something with their website. It could mean an external change; maybe a competitor made an anouncement that is pulling away the traffic. It could also be a market change; maybe users tastes are changing and the company isn't keeping up.
