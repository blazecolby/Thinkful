Sith Lords: There is a bias in that they are only testing with droids. I would select a random group from each species/group(droids,humans, jedi, etc). There is also a bias in only testing with 'captured'. They could test the slogans on groups that aren't captured. I'm assuming captured means held against their will. Look at the overall results after the changes, then test each sub-group to see if it fits. 

Jedi PR: There is a bias with giving Jar Jar all of the friendly planets and Mace all of the unfriendly. To fix this they should give 2 of each to Mace and Jar Jar. Their could also be bias with one of them being a Jedi and the other not. To make it more viable they should send out two of the same species. 

HR & IT: Bias will come from the unevenly distributed employees in HR. To fix this they should take a weighted average instead of a normal average. 

Fitness App: The info is biased because when people install the app they start at zero. Overtime the app automatically collects more information, and increasing the cumulative amount of data. If these assumptions are true, to fix this they should track the daily activity rate instead of cumulative. 

Prevent Cheating: She may not have distributed the tests evenly/She didn't pass the exams out randomly. To fix this she should have mixed the tests evenly instead of in chunks. Certain types of students may arrive at different times.
